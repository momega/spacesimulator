Space Simulator
===============

The Space Simulator is OPENGL application written in Java. It simulates the motion (and rotation) of the planets
and spacecraft(s).

The planets are moving based on Keplerian law (simplified elliptical) trajectory.

The position and velocity of spacecraft(s) are computed based on Newtonian gravitational law. The gravitation of all the planets
influences the trajectory of the spacecrafts.

Features
========

* Orbital maneuvers with fuel consumption
* Display planes intersections of the spacecraft and target celestial body
* Time warp
* Display popup dialogs with detail information about all objects
* 7 planets and their moon included in model
* User defined points
* Take a screenshot
* Headless computations
* Sphere of Influence
* Load and save models
