Space Simulator
===============

The Space Simulator is OPENGL application written in Java. It simulates the motion (and rotation) of the planets
and artificialBody(s).

The planets are moving based on Keplerian law (simplified elliptical) trajectory.

The artificialBody(s) are moving based on the Newtonian trajectory. The gravitation of the planets
influences the trajectory of the artificialBody.
